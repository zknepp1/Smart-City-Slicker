ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
1 1 VISION 
Anchorage has a new vision. To build a strong and vibrant Anchorage for everyone.  
 
With leadership and support from Mayor Ethan Berkowitz, motivation is high to leverage 
synergies between municipal systems as a means toward better management. We are confident 
that Anchorage models the attributes of an ideal candidate for the Smart City Challenge. The 
values that are guiding Anchorage’s  vision include:  
 
Excellence:  Consistent delivery of quality work products that are data driven and results oriented. 
Innovation:  Commitment to find thoughtful and creative solutions.  
Talent:  Looking at one another and engaging outside resources for ideas and solutions.  
Inclusion:  The community belongs to all who live here and must reflect that reality.  
Initiative:  Willingness to engage in daring and difficult activities.  
 
Anchorage’s  four priorities and challenges align with USDOT’ s twelve vision elements:

We know there are solutions that will lead us towards cultivating Anchorage’s vision. Key 
elements include accessible, open data sharing to build transparency throughout the community, 
enabling the public to help solve some of our challenges, and ultimately creating new 
opportunities. Linking Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in various key 
municipal service and infrastructure sectors, such as water, power, and transportation, will 
enable better decision making and leverage municipal resources. GIS is a critical supporting 
technology powering Anchorage’s vision, feeding all of  major munici pal systems . Anchorage ’s 
Regional ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) Architecture Implementation Plan identifies 
technology projects that are needed over the next 10 years, as identified by agency personnel, 
including a multi-agency Traffic Operations Center and municipal support of the Alaska 511 
traveler information system. Projects included in the ITS Architecture support the majority of the 
Smart City Challenge vision elements. 
Optimization of economic and fiscal cross-benefits to be derived from these plans and projects 
will require a more holistic view. For example, sensors that monitor parking and traffic in real-
time can also provide detection and monitoring of situations or events (e.g., water line 
breakages or traffic) to assist Anchorage Water and Wastewater and Utility, with decision 
support. Traffic detection camera images can be shared with Anchorage Police Department and 
Alaska State Troopers in the event of accidents to assist with incident response. 
Anchorage proposes to embark on a project that engages key municipal and state agencies to 
develop an ICT Concept of Operations and Architecture. The ICT will establish the goals and 
objectives in developing the larger vision for technology, information and data sharing, and a 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
3 work program that identifies tangible steps needed to achieve the USDOT’s  vision integration 
and improve Anchorage’s capacity to make data driven decisions .  
Anchorage is focused on results; we look forward to sharing our experience and success .  
2 POPULATION 
As the largest city in Alaska, Anchorage’s population of 251, 243 accounts for 40% of the state’s 
population. Located in southcentral Alaska, Anchorage is the hub of the state’s communication, 
transportation, military, health care, finance, and trade industries. These industries are 
constantly improving and innovating by upgrading technologies, providing competitive services, 
and offering new services. Anchorage is a modern city with a diverse population. 100 languages 
are spoken in the Anchorage School District. Mountain View, a northeast Anchorage 
neighborhood, boasts the most diverse census tract in all of America. Additionally, 100% of 
Anchorage’s population resides  within the urbanized area.  
3 CHARACTERISTICS  
As a northern city, Anchorage is well known for its winter climate. However, our winter climate is 
not the primary focus of this application. Our primary focus with this application is to build a 
strong and 
vibrant Anchorage for everyone. Anchorage’s public transit provider, People Mover 
turned 41 years old in 2015. People Mover provides public transportation to the Anchorage, 
Eagle River, Chugiak and Peters Creek areas which encompass 77 square miles. People Mover 
maintains a fleet of 52 accessible, ADA compliant buses that travel over two million miles a year. 
Seven days a week, People Mover operates 14 fixed routes around the Downtown transit center 
and three satellite hubs. People Mover provides 4.1 million trips annually, with an average 
weekday ridership of 14,297. Additionally, AnchorRIDES is a shared ride service providing ADA 
transportation service to people with disabilities, seniors, and other contracted trips. 
As a young and growing city , Anchorage is  a place for all ages where you can live close to work, 
make a competitive salary , and have a plethora of options for entertainment and outdoor 
activities.  Our partner, Anchorage Economic Development Corporation is leading the charge to 
make Anchorage the #1 city in America to Live. Work. Play  by 2025. There are many things that 
make this city an amazing place to call home; however to be the #1 city in th e nation to live, 
work, and play, we must continually improve and invest. Therefore, Anchorage provides an 
environment that is conducive to dem onstrating the proposed ICT Concept of Operations and 
Architecture . 
On May 5th, 2015, the people of Anchorage elected Ethan Berkowitz to be their next mayor, and 
to lead Alaska’s largest city into its next centennial.  Within two weeks, Mayor-elect Berkowitz 
announced a transition team to create a blueprint for a safe, secure, and strong Anchorage. The 
charge was to create a forward thinking transition report that recognized the unique challenges 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
4 and opportunities we have, while identifying the steps his administration could take to more 
effectively address the critical issues that face Anchorage. He assembled a team of three co-
chairs, ten sub-committee co-chairs, along with over 125 community and business leaders, 
practitioners and end-users, organized into five issues specific working groups. Each committee 
hosted 18 to 25 people, and the rosters were comprised of a diverse group of participants, from 
a wide range of backgrounds and cultures. The five committees were tasked with examining 
Mayor- elect Berkowitz’s key areas of concerns, and developing a collaborative and 
comprehensive approach to addressing the specific area of focus. Four focus areas included 
Public Safety, Homelessness, Business Excellence, and Revitalized and Resilient Neighborhoods. 
To ensure even greater public participation, Mayor-elect Berkowitz hosted four town hall 
meetings and a community diversity celebration over a two-week period in June. These public 
events drew almost 1,000 people combined, and gave Anchorage residents an opportunity to 
share their thoughts on the future with the next mayor. By the end of June, each committee had 
produced a final draft of their recommendations arising from the presentations they’d received 
from the outgoing administration, committee discussions and public conversations. As outlined 
in Mayor Berkowitz cover letter Anchorage is focused, highly motivated, and employs the 
continuity of committed leadership and capacity to carry out the demonstration throughout the 
period of performance.  
Anchorage faces fiscal headwinds from declining oil prices and military downsizing, and 
recognizes the need to become resilient through economic diversification; strategic 
development and redevelopment efforts of key neighborhoods- particularly our struggling 
downtown; and support entrepreneurial activity. A commitment to integrating the sharing 
economy is a natural fit as Anchorage diversifies its economy. Anchorage is a 2016 Smart Growth 
America  grantee, as a result, technical assistance will focus on a range of issues including transit-
oriented development, Complete Streets, smart growth zoning, economic development and 
fiscal health, parking management and regional planning for small communities, among other 
topics. 
As a Bloomberg Philanthropies “ What Works City ” grantee, Anchorage has publicly committed to 
establish and improve its open data practices in order to make the city’s data more accessible to 
city managers and the public, engage residents around government priorities and services, and 
increase transparency and accountability. By publishing high-quality city data, Anchorage can, 
fuel innovation and entrepreneurship while making it easier for the public to engage and access 
government services. 
4 SITE MAP 
The site for Anchorage’s ICT Concept of Operations and Architecture will reflect the MPO 
boundaries. Anchorage Metropolitan Area Transportation Solutions (AMATS) is the MPO for the 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
5 urbanized area as designated by Governor Jay Hammond on April 8, 1976. Additionally, in 1997 
the U.S. Secretary of Transportation designated AMATS as a Transportation Management Area 
(TMA). It is AMATS’ responsibility to meet the requirements of the FAST ACT for the 
Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA). These requirements call for the development of a 
multimodal transportation system that integrates with land use plans, reflects the 3C planning 
process, and meets Federal and State planning requirements. The site map is located in 
Appendix A. 
5 APPROACH 
As it relates to transportation, the twelve USDOT vision elements are woven into many of 
Anchorage’s adopted Transportation Plans including: the Interim 2035 Metropolitan 
Transportation Plan, Anchorage 2020 Comprehensive Plan, the Human Service Coordinated 
Transportation Plan, the Congestion Management Process, the Pedestrian Plan, the Bicycle Plan, 
People Mover Blueprint, and the Freight Mobility Study. The Smart City Challenge provides 
Anchorage with an opportunity to holistically integrate the technology solutions that were 
recommended for implementation in federally funded planning efforts listed above. In reviewing 
the trends from Beyond Traffic 2045 for the ICT Concept of Operations and Architecture 
proposal, we recognize the significance of Secretary Foxx’s sentiments regarding the trends. 
Therefore, Anchorage is committing to working towards the three strategies outlined below.  
     1. Take better care of our legacy transportation systems. 
     2. Build what is new and necessary. 
     3. Use technologies and better design approaches that will allow us to maximize the use of 
our old and new transportation assets.   
What follows highlights how Anchorage is currently meeting the intent of the twelve visions or is 
planning to integrate the visions as part of the ICT Concept of Operations and Architecture. 
TECHNOLOGY ELEMENTS 
5.1 Vision Element #1: Urban Automation 
Anchorage recognizes the ability of automated transportation to enhance safety, mobility, and 
accessibility, equity, and the environment. Examples of automated transportation planned for 
the Anchorage area includes: 
Traffic Operations Center (TOC) : There has been significant discussion about establishing a 
transportation operation center in the Anchorage area. There is currently a multi-agency group 
looking at what TOC functions are needed and how best to meet those needs. The group will 
also assess the configuration of the TOC, with options ranging from a brick and mortar building 
to a completely virtual TOC. When that work is completed, the recommendations will need to be 
implemented. There will likely be multiple projects starting in the near term and extending 
beyond to implement the recommendations. 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
6 Traffi c Signal Controller Upgrade : The existing traffic signal controllers are relatively old. The 
features and capabilities of the controllers are constrained because of this. There is a current 
effort to upgrade signal controllers. This effort will continue in the near-term.   
5.2 Vision Element #2: Connected Vehicles 
The opportunity to utilize connected infrastructure in order to improve safety, increase mobility, 
and achieve environmental gains are of great interest to Anchorage. Efficient, real-time, 
responsive mobility solutions have to ability to positively impact our community by reducing 
congestion and by providing valuable transportation data for planners and operators. Automated 
vehicles 
and vehicles connected to each other and to infrastructure will be upon us soon, and 
Anchorage must prepare. Examples of connected infrastructure planned for the Anchorage area 
includes: 
Transit Signal Priority (TSP):  The Municipality  and its Public Trans it Department piloted TSP 
systems on routes 7 and 9 within Anchorage . TSP at additional locations will help the 
Municipality’s transit provider to achieve and maintain on -time performance. In turn this will 
reduce travel time, making transit more favorable to the public. TSP may also assist with 
emergency response during disasters for evacuation, triage, etc. Further implementation of TSP 
is on -hold until the traffic signal controller upgrade project is complete.  
Signal Priority for Maintenance Vehicles:  Transit vehicles have the ability to request priority at 
traffic signals using on-board systems. Allowing maintenance vehicles such as snow plows the 
same ability allows for maintenance work to be completed more quickly and therefore cause 
fewer disruptions to traffic flow. This is particularly important for snow plows to allow them to 
proceed on their routes as expeditiously as possible. The usage of signal priority systems could 
also include automatic vehicle location (AVL) capabilities and turn-signal linkage. 
Currently, neither the Municipality nor the State of Alaska have plans to build roadside 
infrastructure that can connect directly to vehicles (e.g., road signs embedded with ability to 
communicate with private vehicles). As a result of this application, the Municipality/State of 
Alaska may elect to conduct a cost/benefit analysis, including maintenance costs, to determine if 
deployment of this technology is warranted. The connected vehicle environment is not included 
in the current ITS Architecture update; however, MPO staff is researching how to include it in the 
2040 Metropolitan Transportation Plan Update. 
5.3 Vision Element #3: Intelligent, Sensor-Based Infrastructure 
Cameras and sensors can be used by multiple Departments for a variety of purposes. With 
permissions granted, and given proper controls for privacy (e.g., real-time traffic cameras can be 
used by Fire and Police to assess incidents and determine appropriate levels of response; parking 
sensors/cameras can assist water utilities with detection of water main breaks; transit center 
security cameras can be connected to Police for incident monitoring/response.) Multi-
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
7 department/agency agreements should be identified up-front, before technologies are 
implemented, to keep implementation costs down. Examples of Intelligent, Sensor-Based 
Infrastructure planned for the Anchorage area includes: 
Bicycle Detection and Warnings:  The adopted Bicycle Plan includes an Action Item 
Recommendation to consider visual or motion detection as options for detecting bicycles at 
signalized intersections where a high level of bicycle use exists or is anticipated. This strategy can 
include camera, radar, or other detection. The strategy can be used to detect bicycles as input to 
the traffic signal controller as well as providing warnings to drivers of motorized vehicles of the 
presence of bicyclists through means of dynamic message signs, or flashing warning signs. 
Closed Circuit Television (CCTV):  CCTV provides agencies, operators and the public with real-time 
images of traffic, and incidents that occur on regional roadways. Anchorage Police Department 
and Anchorage Fire Department have specifically voiced their interest in an expansion of camera 
coverage. Camera images could also help Maintenance staff in making decisions regarding their 
operations. Images can be used to verify reports from the field, and to determine the type of 
equipment needed to treat injured persons and remove accidents and/or debris from the 
roadway. There are cameras currently in place within the Municipality. This effort would expand 
the coverage
 of cameras in the Municipality. 
Parkin
g Space Sensors:  The Municipality is planning to implement a new parking management 
system. 
This system will be able to provide parking occupancy and availability information so 
travelers will know where parking spaces are available. It will also include wayfinding features to 
provide travelers with information on how to get to the available spaces. This project is in mid-
term because the parking revenue control system has to be updated first. It is envisioned that 
information will be displayed on signs along the streets and on a traveler information website. 
Highway-Rail Intersection (HRI) Warnings:  It is envisioned that the Municipality will implement 
HRI Warning systems located near highway-rail intersections. This will improve driver awareness 
of oncoming trains and improve safety at HRIs. Railroad information collected from the Alaska 
Railroad Corporation (ARRC) wayside equipment and detectors would provide the needed data 
for this feature. Advanced train detection could collect data such as train speed, location, arrival 
times, and crossing delays. By collecting and distributing this information to travelers and 
agencies, motorists could choose their routes and times of travel to minimize delays caused by 
rail crossings. Dynamic message signs will be the primary mechanism for providing this 
information, although it could also be displayed on a traveler information website and through 
smartphone apps.  
Cameras and sensors for one purpose can be used by other Departments for other purposes, 
with permissions granted, and given proper controls for privacy (e.g., real-time traffic cameras 
can be used by Fire and Police to assess incidents and determine appropriate levels of response; 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
8 parking sensors/cameras can assist water utilities with detection of water main breaks; transit 
center security cameras can be connected to Police for incident monitoring/response.) Multi-
department/agency agreements should be identified up-front, before technologies are 
implemented, to keep implementation costs down. 
INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO URBAN TRANSPORTATION ELEMENTS 
5.4 Vision Element #4: Urban Analytics 
Anchorage is a data-rich environment. Thirty seven Municipal departments are collecting a variety of 
data that could be integrate that data in order to address our complex urban challenges, 
performance measures, improve services and current operations. Examples of Urban Analytics in 
the Anchorage area includes: 
Data Archive Investigation to Support Multi-Agency Data Sharing:  Currently, agencies in the region 
maintain their own data repositories. This makes it convenient for internal operations in terms of 
accessing historic data within one’s ag ency, but not as convenient for obtaining data from others. 
The aim of Data Archive service area is to support multi-agency data sharing. By creating a 
central Archive Data Services system that different agencies can contribute to, access to a more 
abundant amount of historic data becomes streamlined and readily attainable for the 
participating agencies. There is currently no consensus on the organization or management 
approach to a centralized data archive. The first step would be to conduct a study on the specific 
needs for data archiving and how best to meet those needs. This study should consider various 
types of data to be archived, the priority for archiving each type, where such an archive would 
best fit among the regional agencies in terms of ownership and operations, and the potential 
policies and procedures connected to the archive. (A second effort to implement the archive is 
suggested in the midterm.) 
Common Geographic Information System (GIS):  The Municipality currently has a common GIS 
platform. All departments and divisions have access to that platform. There will continue to be 
additional needs for GIS layers and applications. These efforts will follow the greatest needs of 
the departments and divisions. 
Shared Traffic Database:  Within the overall data archive, traffic data shared and easily retrieved 
traffic data was noted by many agencies as a need. An initial focus of a regional data archive 
should be on implementing a shared database for traffic data. This will reduce the burden on 
agencies to collect data or search for data that already exists somewhere within the Municipality . 
Part of this
 effort should also investigate geo-coding traffic data so it can be displayed on a GIS 
layer to graphically display the information. 
Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Detection for Travel Time:  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth detectors can be used to 
determine travel times on the roadway network. This system could provide high quality travel 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
9 time for the purpose of modifying traffic signal timing, for performance monitoring, and to post 
travel times to the public on the web. This technology exists and is cost-effective to implement. 
A first step would be to design and implement a pilot study to determine how well it works to 
support traffic signal timing changes, and (if successful) how best to expand the system.   
Road Weather Information Systems (RWIS) Data Sharing:  AKDOT&PF currently operates RWIS in 
the Municipality and the surrounding area. A mechanism to share this information with 
Maintenance staff within the Municipality would help in determining the most effective winter 
maintenance 
actions. 
5.5 Vision Element #5: User-Focused Mobility Services and Choices 
Anchorage’s Travel Options programs encourage residents, commuters, and visitors to get out of 
their private automobile for more trips and provide opportunities for them to walk, bike, share 
rides, and take transit. These programs are coordinated efforts - between AMATS and Public 
Transit, the business community, universities and other institutions, and area nonprofits - that 
provide education, information, incentives, and other resources to encourage alternatives to 
driving alone. Anchorage is becoming more sustainable, encouraging different modes of travel, 
implementing the Bicycle Plan and Pedestrian Plan, and supporting Integrated Mobility through 
use of a new Smart Phone app for multi-modal trip planning. 
Multi-modal Trip Planner:  AMATS is currently working on a multi-modal trip planner hosted by 
RideAmigos that includes a smartphone app. This piece of technology will enhance the overall 
mobility for
 the community including people with disabilities, seniors, and Millennials. The data 
will be consolidated and available for other organizations to use for their planning purposes.  
Traveler Information Web Site:  There are several real -time data sources either available or 
proposed that would be valuable to display on a traveler information website. CCTV camera 
images are some of the most popular types of traveler information. The existing and any planned 
CCTV images, either full motion or stills, could be displayed. In addition, information on travel 
times from the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth detectors could also be displayed. Information on incidents, 
planned construction closures, or special events that affect traffic could also be included. As 
additional real-time or planned data was available, it could be added to the website. 
Intelligent Transit Stops:  Ranges from kiosks, which show static transit schedules, to real-time 
information on schedules, locations of transit vehicles, arrival time of the vehicle, and alternative 
routes and modes. This is shown in the mid-term because Public Transportation will be tied up 
with existing projects and determining their technology refresh in the near term. 
Fare Payment:  Customers and the Public Transit Department would like to provide a mechanism 
for customers to recharge their transit accounts on-line and/or through a smartphone app. A 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
10 project to investigate the best mechanisms for Anchorage would be a first step followed by an 
implementation projec t. 
Integration with Alaska 511:  The existing condition entry system that AKDOT&PF has connects 
directly to their 511 system and the information can be shared among a variety of agencies. 
Authorized personnel in the Municipality such as police, fire, and traffic operators, can input and 
retrieve traffic information and roadway conditions directly into the statewide database. 
Personnel could enter and retrieve data through use of mobile devices as well. Once entered, 
the information is available for everyone to see simultaneously, reducing the time needed to 
report this information to individual agencies or to the public. Currently Municipality has a 
Memorandum of Agreement with AKDOT&PF to do this. The Anchorage Police Department 
recently agreed to an approach where incident information is directly fed to AKDOT&PF through 
its Nixel feed. 
Parking Management:  The Municipality is planning to implement a new parking management 
system. 
This system will be able to provide parking occupancy and availability information so 
travelers will know where parking spaces are available. It will also include wayfinding features to 
provide travelers with information on how to get to the available spaces. This project is in mid-
term because the parking revenue control system has to be updated first. It is envisioned that 
information will be displayed on signs along the streets and on a traveler information website.  
5.6 Vision Element #6: Urban Delivery and Logistics 
Anchorage is the gateway connection to the world for Alaska; freight shipments from elsewhere 
sustain the state and local economies. Modernizing the Port of Anchorage is essential for 
accommodating larger vessels and adapting to changing requirements and technologies.  Trucks 
of all sizes distribute goods that arrive and depart by air, sea, and rail carrying freight to, from 
and through the Anchorage metropolitan area and the region beyond. Freight distribution is an 
integral part of the daily economic activity of the Municipality, freight travel patterns affect 
traffic and are affected by the efficiency of the road network.  
An update to the Freight Mobility Plan is currently under way. This document will examine 
innovative solutions that effectively and efficiently move goods – including food, energy, and 
manufactured goods, the use data or deploying technology to create opportunities for a more 
efficient supply chain approach that delivers safer logistics management, improved on-time 
pickups and delivery, improved travel time reliability, reduced fuel consumption, and reduced 
labor and vehicle maintenance costs. 
5.7 Vision Element #7: Strategic Business Models and Partnering Opportunities 
Anchorage welcomes this opportunity to leverage creative, strategic partnerships that will draw 
in stakeholders and maximize resources and investments. Our partners include municipal 
departments; the Mat-Su Borough; the general public; the Anchorage Economic Development 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
11 Corporation; the Anchorage Community Development Authority; Alaska Native corporations and 
tribal groups; the Alaska Railroad; Code for Anchorage; the University of Alaska Anchorage; and 
others.  
5.8 Vision Element #8: Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification, and Electric Vehicles 
While Electric Vehicles were not identified in the ITS Architecture update; the construction of a 
state- of-the-art natural gas power plant, coupled with increased energy efficiency measures in 
the municipality creates the potential for excess electrical generation capacity that clears the 
way for reduced costs for electric vehicle fleets.   
With this additional capacity available, Anchorage plans to transition our Municipal fleets, 
including buses, to electric vehicles. This process would include installing charging stations in 
Municipal parking lots, within our Municipal Light & Power utility service area, and eventually 
throughout all of Anchorage for use by all public and private electric vehicle owners.  
Additionally, the Anchorage owned electric utility, Municipal Light & Power, intends to install a 
Smart Grid metering infrastructure pilot program within the next year. Coupling this system with 
enhanced data collection systems across the Municipality would create an even stronger 
platform for informed decision making in the future.   
5.9 Vision Element #9: Connected, Involved Citizens 
Anchorage’s citizens are connected on multiple levels. First they are connected in the sense they 
participate and are active within the community on matters of local and state government. 
Second, they are connected by the data they generate, share, and use. As outlined in their letter 
of support, our partner Code for Anchorage has worked successfully with several Municipal 
departments in order to use their data in new and useful ways. AMATS is currently working on a 
multi-modal trip planner hosted by RideAmigos that includes a smartphone app. This piece of 
technology will enhanc
e the overall mobility for the community including people with disabilities, 
seniors, and Millennials. The data will be consolidated and available for other organizations to 
use for their planning purposes.    
SMART CITY ELEMENTS 
5.10 Vision Element #10: Architecture and Standards 
As it relates to transportation in Anchorage, AMATS maintains the Regional ITS Architecture and 
Turbo Architecture™ . The Turbo Architecture™ supports FHWA Rule 940 and FTA National ITS 
Architecture Policy on Transit Projects.  
5.11 Vision Element #11: Low-Cost, Efficient, Secure, and Resilient Information and 
Communications Technology 
This vision element is the heart of Anchorage’s Smart City Challenge proposal. Developing an ICT 
Concept of Operations and Architecture will provide Anchorage with strategies and practices 
that advance information and communications technology (ICT) that is affordable, adaptable, 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
12 efficient, secure and resilient, including integrated telecommunications platforms, enterprise 
software, storage, and visualization systems. This will include ICT that contributes to one 
common operating platform to inform city government decision-making. ICT infrastructure, 
technologies, and services are a critical part of a Smart City. ICT consists of unified 
communications and the integration of telecommunications, computers as well as necessary 
enterprise software, storage, and visualization systems, which enable users to access, store, 
transmit, and manipulate information.  
5.12 Vision Element #12: Smart Land Use 
Anchorage recognizes that land use and transportation are tightly intertwined.  Established land 
uses in the metropolitan area are constrained in many locations by geographical features such as 
coastlines, mountains, and stream corridors. These established land uses have influenced the 
travel patterns that exist today.  Understanding the relationship between the distribution of 
housing and employment is critical to project future transportation demand. The geographical 
distribution of land uses, development densities, site designs, and proximity to complementary 
uses directly influence the number and length of trips, mode choice, viability of walking and 
cycling, the attractiveness of transit service, and travel origin-destination patterns.  
The regional population growth projections show the most dramatic population growth 
occurring in the Mat-Su Borough (119%), followed by Chugiak-Eagle River (74%), and Anchorage 
(15%). Physical growth and common interest are jointly affecting the Municipality and the Mat-
Su Borough. The two jurisdictions together house the majority of the population and 
employment in the state. Travel interactions and economic interest argue for collaboration on 
many fronts. As the urban region continues to grow, pressure is mounting on the amount of land 
remaining in Anchorage for development.  
Currently, land use and transportation are being considered together as Anchorage’s  Land Use 
Plan Map is being updated and land use strategies are being considered as part of the Spenard 
Corridor Strategic Plan. Planners are working together toward development of an 
implementation plan for Transit Oriented Development along Transit Supportive Corridors. 
6 RISKS 
Risks involved in the ICT Concept of Operations and Architecture project are minimal. At this 
point there are no technical, policy, or institutional risks associated with the deployment vision. 
Meaningful public involvement, project communication, and education will be critical 
components of the project for all Municip al Departments and the general public.

Anchorage is open to public and/or private partnerships in order to address the four priorities 
outlined as part of our vision : Public Safety, Homelessness, Business Excellence, and Revitalized 
and Resilient Neighborhoods. The Municipal governance process is found in Appendix B .  
8 EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
Ownership of roads is shared by local, state, and federal governments and private entities. There 
are 277 signalized intersections managed by the Municipality on its arterial network and State-
managed traffic signals on State-owned facilities. The State of Alaska owns most of the most 
heavily used arterial streets and freeways. The remaining roads are owned by the Municipality of 
Anchorage
. In some cases, sections of the same road are owned by both entities and are 
indicative of the importance of close intergovernmental cooperation and collaboration. 
Ownership of roads by the federal government occurs on federal lands, such as Joint Base 
Elmendorf-Richardson. Some private roads within the MPO boundary are owned by residents 
who use and maintain them. The surface transportation system includes: 
 
Freeway: 51 Centerline Miles 
Expressway: 2 Centerline Miles 
Arterial: 174 Centerline Miles 
Collector: 149 Centerline Miles 
Local Street: 1,130 Centerline Miles 
Bicycle Lane: 13 Centerline Miles 
Pedestrian System: 521 miles of sidewalk 
Trail System: 243 miles of separated multi-use trails 
  
Transit services:  
People Mover is the fixed-Route bus service in the metropolitan area operated by the 
Municipality of Anchorage Public Transit Department. Bus service ranges from 30-60 minute 
headways during the weekday peak and generally every 60 minutes for all other hours including 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
14 weekends. Service between Chugiak-Eagle River and Anchorage is available on Eagle River 
Connect, Monday through Friday. 
 
Valley Mover is a public commuter service that operates between the Mat-Su Borough and 
Anchorage. Valley Mover offers 14 round trips a day,  Monday-Friday.  
Shared-use mobility services:  
AnchorRIDES provides demand-response, curb- to-curb transportation service to people with 
disabilities that prevent them from using People Mover (fixed-route system) and senior citizens.  
 
The Anchorage School District provides transportation for students who live more than 1.5 miles 
from their school or who live along routes designated as hazardous for walking are eligible to 
ride a school bus.  
 
Vanpooling is supported by Public Transit’s Share -A-Ride program and contracted by vRide. Of 
the 56 vanpools in operation, 53 originate from the Mat-Su Borough. 
Carpooling with in the Anchorage area is currently informal. People use Twitter, Craigslist, 
Zimride, Ridester, erideshare, and carpool world. The MPO is currently working on a project that 
will drastically improve carpooling and schoolpooling efforts across the state.   
 
Taxi service in Anchorage is provided by Alaska Yellow Cab and Checker Cab. 
 
Bikeshare is available through the University of Alaska Anchorage. 
 
The Municipality is looking to partner with the University of Alaska Anchorage to expand 
carsharing throughout Anchorage. Additionally, we are looking at an electric carsharing fleet to 
be able to capitalize on the excess electrical generation capacity from the new natural gas power 
plant under construction in Anchorage.  
 
A variety of human service shuttles and private shuttles operate within Anchorage. Some allow 
the general public 
to ride, while others only transport their clients, students, or employees. 
 
Information and communication technology (ICT):  
Anchorage’s Smart City Challenge proposal is for an ICT Concept of Operations and Architecture.  
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) including transportation management centers and field 
equipment:  
  
Smart Grid Infrastructure including electric vehicle charging infrastructure:  
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
15 As part of Vision Element #8: Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification, and Electric Vehicles 
Anchorage is planning for excess electrical generation capacity. This includes transitioning our 
Municipal fleets, including buses, to electric vehicles. This process would include installing 
charging stations in Municipal parking lots, within our Municipal Light & Power utility service 
area, and eventually throughout all of Anchorage for use by all public and private electric vehicle 
owners.  
9 DATA COLLECTION 
There is data being collected by the thirty-seven Municipal departments. Currently, the 
Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility hosts the GIS Center for Excellence. The Municipal 
Maps and Apps  gallery is a product the Center; at its existing capacity the Center deals with a 
limited amount of data. The Center has a vision for Enterprise GIS for Anchorage that is a 
strategic resource for sharing of timely, accurate, and reliable geographical information for all 
municipal departments, public agencies, and the public at large. Anchorage’s ICT Concept of 
Operations and Architecture project will identify the lead, additional project partners and 
stakeholders in order to integrate the data that the city is already collecting to improve 
management and operations.  
10 EXISTING POLICIES 
Currently there are not policies in place applicable to the proposed data to be collected and 
shared as part of Anchorage’s ICT Concept of Operations and Architecture project application.  
11 EXISTING STANDARDS 
Not applicable at the time of Anchorage’s ICT Concept of Operations and Architecture project 
application.  
12 PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
Performance measures for the ICT Concept of Operations and Architecture project have yet to 
be defined. Metrics could include increases in mobility, safety, system efficiency, economic 
vitality, and sustainability; and reductions in congestion, environmental impacts, and gaps in 
service. Additional performance measures should include Anchorage’s f our focus areas: Public 
Safety, Homelessness, Business Excellence, and Revitalized and Resilient Neighborhoods. 
13 CAPACITY 
The Municipality possesses the Technical Capacity to implement and administer the ICT Concept 
of Operations and Architecture. Projects funded by the USDOT are implemented in accordance 
with the grant application, Master Agreement, and all applicable laws and regulations, using 
sound management practices. 
ANCHORAGE, AK SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
ICT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE 
16 The Municipality is eligible and authorized under state and local law to request, receive, and 
dispense USDOT funds and to execute and administer federally funded projects. FY 2015 Annual 
List of Certifications and Assurances were signed by the authorized official and attorney.  
Additionally, there are no legal issues that have impact on Anchorage's federal program. The 
Municipality continues to demonstrate its ability to match and manage USDOT grant funds; 
cover cost increases and operating deficits while financially maintaining and operating federally 
funded programs and facilities. Anchorage conducts and responds to applicable audits and there 
are no outstanding financial issues that would impact Anchorage's federal program. An adequate 
financial management system is in place, allowing grant balances to be tracked accurately. 
14 RESOURCES 
Anchorage has several mechanisms in place to leverage its Federal resources. AMATS recently 
used Crowd Sourcing to meet the local match requirement for the Freight Mobility Study Update 
that is currently underway.
